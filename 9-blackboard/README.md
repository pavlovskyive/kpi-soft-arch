# Blackboard Pattern

The Blackboard pattern is a software design pattern that enables collaboration among multiple knowledge sources to solve complex problems. It provides a shared repository, known as the blackboard, where knowledge sources can contribute their knowledge and collectively work towards solving a problem.

The blackboard acts as a central hub, facilitating communication and coordination between the knowledge sources. It allows them to share their expertise, exchange information, and collectively make progress towards a solution. The blackboard collects the contributions from different sources and provides a consolidated view of the available knowledge.

The Blackboard pattern is particularly useful in domains where complex problems require the collaboration of multiple specialized knowledge sources. By leveraging the collective intelligence of these sources, the pattern enables more sophisticated problem-solving approaches.

## Example

Consider a scenario where multiple knowledge sources contribute their knowledge to solve a complex problem. Each knowledge source represents a specific domain or expertise. The blackboard serves as the central repository for collecting and sharing the knowledge.

In our example implementation (`blackboard.py`):

- `SourceA` and `SourceB` represent two knowledge sources that contribute their knowledge to the blackboard.
- The `Blackboard` class provides the shared repository where the knowledge is stored.
- The `ProblemSolver` class accesses the knowledge from the blackboard and performs problem-solving tasks.

To see the Blackboard pattern in action, run the main program (`python3 blackboard.py`), which demonstrates the knowledge sources contributing their knowledge to the blackboard, and the problem solver retrieving and processing the data.

## Benefits of the Blackboard Pattern

- Collaborative Problem Solving: The pattern enables multiple knowledge sources to collaborate and contribute their expertise, leading to more effective problem-solving.
- Modularity and Extensibility: Knowledge sources can be added or modified independently, allowing for modular development and easy integration of new sources.
- Shared Knowledge Repository: The blackboard acts as a centralized repository, providing a consolidated view of the available knowledge for analysis and decision-making.

## Considerations

- Knowledge Integration: Ensuring that the knowledge from different sources can be effectively integrated and used by the problem-solving component is essential.
- Knowledge Source Coordination: Coordinating the timing and sequence of knowledge source contributions can be challenging, especially in asynchronous or distributed environments.
- Domain Expertise: Designing knowledge sources that capture the expertise of specific domains is crucial for the success of the Blackboard pattern.
