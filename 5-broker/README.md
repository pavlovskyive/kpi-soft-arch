# Broker Pattern

The Broker pattern is a messaging pattern that facilitates communication and coordination between different components in a system. It involves a central broker that acts as an intermediary, receiving messages from publishers and delivering them to subscribers based on predefined topics.

##Implementation

The implementation of the Broker pattern consists of a `Broker` class that serves as the central messaging broker. The broker maintains a list of subscribers for each topic and provides methods to subscribe to topics and publish messages.

Here is an example implementation of the Broker pattern (`broker.py`):

```python
class Broker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.subscribers = {}

    def subscribe(self, topic, callback):
        if topic not in self.subscribers:
            self.subscribers[topic] = []
        self.subscribers[topic].append(callback)

    def publish(self, topic, message):
        if topic in self.subscribers:
            for callback in self.subscribers[topic]:
                callback(message)
```

In this implementation, the `Broker` class has a subscribe method to register callbacks for specific topics and a publish method to send messages to the subscribers of a particular topic.

## Usage

To use the Broker pattern, follow these steps:

1. reate an instance of the `Broker` class.
2. Define callback functions that will handle the received messages.
3. Subscribe the callback functions to specific topics using the `subscribe` method.
4. Publish messages on topics using the publish method.
5. 
Here is an example of how to use the Broker pattern (`broker.py`):

```python
# Create an instance of the Broker
broker = Broker()

# Define callback functions
def callback1(message):
    print("Received message in callback 1:", message)

def callback2(message):
    print("Received message in callback 2:", message)

# Subscribe callback functions to topics
broker.subscribe("topic1", callback1)
broker.subscribe("topic2", callback2)

# Publish messages on topics
broker.publish("topic1", "Hello from topic 1")
broker.publish("topic2", "Hello from topic 2")
```

In this example, we create a `Broke`r instance, define two callback functions `callback1` and `callback2`, and subscribe them to different topics. We then publish messages on the topics, and the respective callback functions are invoked to handle the received messages.

## Conclusion

The Broker pattern provides a flexible and decoupled way to enable communication and coordination between different components in a system. It allows publishers and subscribers to communicate through a central broker, enabling loose coupling and dynamic messaging.
