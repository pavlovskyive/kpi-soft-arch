## KPI -- Software Architecture Course

This repository contains an implementation of various software architecture patterns in Python. It serves as a practical demonstration of these patterns and their application in building robust and scalable software systems.

## Patterns Implemented

1. [**Layered Architecture Pattern:**](1-layered-architecture/) The codebase follows the Layered Architecture pattern, where the application is divided into layers such as presentation, business logic, and data access. Each layer has a specific responsibility and communicates with adjacent layers through well-defined interfaces.
2. [**Client-Server Pattern:**](2-client-server) The codebase demonstrates the Client-Server pattern, enabling communication and data exchange between clients and a central server.

## Usage

Each pattern implementation resides within its corresponding directory. To run an example or test a pattern, navigate to the respective directory and follow the instructions provided in the README within that directory.
